# hello-world
the first thing I created on github
nobody would understand me in this period, and no one even know who i am including myself 
i am on the way of finding myself and being myself. so i went into this IT job preview, i tried to learn all the coding thing by my self through the Internet. i could find some courses, books, guides and sharings during the off-work time. 
i need to change myself to a new situation, not in this traditional industry and being so bored everyday.
